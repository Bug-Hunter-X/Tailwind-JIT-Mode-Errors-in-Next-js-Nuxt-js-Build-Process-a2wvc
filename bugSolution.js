The solution depends on the specific framework and build setup.  Here are some general strategies:

**1. Verify Tailwind Configuration:**

Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured to include the paths to your template files. 
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ //Important! Include all relevant paths here
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

**2. Adjust Build Process:**

Your framework's build process might be prematurely optimizing or removing files that Tailwind needs.  Try adjusting the build configuration to ensure that the necessary template files are accessible during the JIT compilation step.  This may involve changing webpack loaders, build plugins, or adjusting the order of build tasks.

**3. Check for Conflicting Plugins:**

Some plugins might interfere with Tailwind's JIT mode. Consider temporarily disabling plugins to see if they are causing conflicts.

**4. Use `purge` (Tailwind v2) or `content` (Tailwind v3):**
Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` file correctly points to all files that include Tailwind classes. This is crucial for JIT mode to work correctly.

**5.  Restart your development server or rebuild the application.**  Sometimes a simple restart will clear the cached build artifacts and allow the JIT compiler to work correctly.

**6. Upgrade to the latest versions:** Update your Tailwind CSS, Next.js/Nuxt.js, and Node.js versions to their latest stable releases. This can often resolve compatibility issues that might be leading to the error.
