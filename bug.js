This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, and it's related to how Tailwind's JIT mode interacts with the framework's build process.  The issue arises because the JIT compiler needs to be able to access your template files to generate the necessary CSS. If the build process is too aggressive or if there's a configuration mismatch, Tailwind might not be able to find or process the required templates, leading to missing styles or runtime errors.  For example, you might see an error message like `'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'a.map')` or another error indicating that Tailwind classes aren't being applied.
